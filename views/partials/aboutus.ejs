        <p class="aboutus-contain" > The Annual Techno-Literary-Management Fest of College of Engineering and
            Technology, Bhubaneswar sees a footfall of more than 4,000 students from across
            the state to participate in brainstorming and inquisitive events spanning over 3 days,
            capping it off with a Star-Night. This Year as CET students shined in various hackathons and fests across the nation, we decided to bring all those people to our den and
            compete at a higher level.
